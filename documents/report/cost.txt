To calculate the effort and time required for a simple flashcard app with a team size of 2 developers, we can use the same formula as before:

Effort = Size * Productivity Factor
Time = Effort / Team Size

Estimate the size of the project:
For a simple flashcard app, let's assume that the size of the project is around 2000 lines of code (LOC).

Determine the productivity factor:
The productivity factor takes into account the team's experience, development tools, and other factors. For a simple flashcard app, we can assume a productivity factor of 20 LOC/hour.

Calculate the effort required:
Effort = Size * Productivity Factor
Effort = 2000 LOC * 20 LOC/hour
Effort = 40,000 hours

Determine the team size:
The team size for this scenario is 2 developers.

Calculate the time required:
Time = Effort / Team Size
Time = 40,000 hours / 2 developers
Time = 20,000 hours

Therefore, to develop a simple flashcard app with a team size of 2 developers and a productivity factor of 20 LOC/hour, it would take approximately 20,000 hours or around 1,000 days to complete. However, as before, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and the actual effort and time required may vary depending on various factors, such as the developers' experience, development tools, and other project-specific considerations.
